# Sales Dashboard Analysis at HorizonEdge Co.

## Overview
As a Data Analyst, I built an interactive sales dashboard in Excel to analyze performance across sales reps, regions, and channels. The project aimed to identify top performers, assess regional contributions, and recommend strategies to boost revenue, targeting a potential online sales increase.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 2023 sales records with 998 rows and 13 columns: Sales Rep, Region, Channel, Product, Units Sold, Revenue, and Payment Method... 

## Tools and Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: PivotTables for aggregating data, slicers for dynamic filtering.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts to highlight trends.
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical summaries to identify patterns.

## Analysis Process
1. Imported sales data into Excel and converted it to a Table for dynamic updates.
2. Created PivotTables to summarize revenue by sales rep.
3. Added slicers to filter by region.
4. Analyzed monthly performance.
5. Examined payment methods.

## Results and Insights
- **Sales Rep**: David led with $1.13M, peaking in October (965 units).
- **Region**: Southern region at 27.48%, Northern at $1.37M, driven by clothing.
- **Channel**: Online at $576,798, key for Alice and Bob.
- **Product**: Furniture at 1,663 units by David.
- **Payment**: Credit card at 35.80% for David.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Challenge**: Inconsistent regional data, resolved using Excel filters. Additionally, I faced the constraint of very little data at my disposal, which limited the depth of analysis initially, requiring creative use of available metrics.
- **Learning**: Mastered slicers for user-friendly filtering, enhancing dashboard usability. This experience also taught me to maximize insights from limited datasets, sharpening my problem-solving skills under constraints.

## Future Work
- Explore Power BI for advanced visualizations.
- Integrate predictive analytics to forecast sales trends.
